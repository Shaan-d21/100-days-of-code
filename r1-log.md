The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 24, Thursday, 2023].

## Day 1: Solved basic array problems on leetcode

### August 24, 2023
## Today's Progress:

Day One of the #100DaysOfCode challenge has kicked off with a satisfying coding spree! I delved into the world of arrays, tackling a range of problems spanning both the easy and medium levels. Armed with my trusty C++ skills, I set out to conquer these challenges, and conquer I did!

From basic array manipulations to more intricate problem-solving, today's journey was a fusion of learning and doing. I rekindled my familiarity with C++ syntax and unleashed the power of arrays to solve problems that required thoughtful logic and precise implementation.
