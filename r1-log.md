# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Shaan Dewang

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 24, Thursday, 2023].

## Day 5: Navigating Binary Search Waters

### August 28, 2023
## Today's Progress:

Armed with the arsenal of binary search techniques, I delved into a series of challenges. Firstly, I conquered an easy-level question from Striver’s SDE Sheet by "Take U Forward" on LeetCode. The simplicity of the problem belied its ability to prod my analytical thinking. It was a reminder that elegance often resides in simplicity.

Next came the medium-level question on LeetCode. Aiming for a more robust solution, I set out to code an efficient algorithm. However, the path to success wasn't without its bumps and twists. Despite initial hurdles and time-consuming attempts, I pressed on. The "aha" moment arrived, and the solution finally crystallized.

## Day 4: Conquering Challenges and Exploring Approaches

### August 27, 2023
## Today's Progress:

Today's puzzle tasked me with finding the maximum number of groups that could be formed from a given grade array, with a twist – there were some intriguing conditions to consider. Initially, the problem posed a formidable challenge. It's true that even the most experienced programmers encounter hurdles at times, and this was one of those moments for me.

## Day 3: Navigating Arrays with Two-Pointer Magic

### August 26, 2023
## Today's Progress:

With C++ as my trusty ship, I embarked on solving an array problem that demanded finding the intersection of two arrays. Armed with the two-pointer technique, I navigated through the arrays with precision. To my delight, I managed to crack the code in a mere 2-3 attempts! The satisfaction of arriving at the correct solution was a reward in itself.
