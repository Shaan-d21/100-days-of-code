## Day 3: Navigating Arrays with Two-Pointer Magic

### August 26, 2023
## Today's Progress:

With C++ as my trusty ship, I embarked on solving an array problem that demanded finding the intersection of two arrays. Armed with the two-pointer technique, I navigated through the arrays with precision. To my delight, I managed to crack the code in a mere 2-3 attempts! The satisfaction of arriving at the correct solution was a reward in itself.
